# MacMeters

Status bar indicators to monitor your mac Mac.

I was using the wonderful MenuMeters by Alex Harper, but it has been broken by the new OSX El Capitan. So I choose to create my own status bar icons to monitor my computer.

Please note that the project is at an early stage, a lot of things remain to be done.

Actually the colors of the indicators are suited for the Apple Dark theme.
